# Black_Jack
It is a striped down version of Black Jack in python as my second project.

You bet a certain amount
You and the dealer start with 2 cards and the dealer reveals one of their card.
"Hit" to get a card and "Stay" to stop getting cards.
And try to get close to 21. If you go above 21 you lose. If the dealer gets closer to 21 than you then also you lose.
If you win you will get back double the amount.
If you lose all your money then the game ends

I hope you like this game :)
